# Set up for our explorers

**NOTE:** This is a work in progress.

Here's a list up all the explorers and apps we maintain, along with setup instructions for each. Most of these are documented in other locations. This doc attempts to gather all those links into one place

This assumes that everything in the [computer setup](computer-setup.md) section has been installed.

## Salaries

The basic setup is documented on in its [Github repo](https://github.com/texastribune/salaries.texastribune.org).

How to update salaries in [documented on Confluence](https://wiki.texastribune.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=12420703).

You will need SSH into the production server in order to update the DB. You will first need to create a `~/.ssh/config` file if you don't have one already. And then copy the salaries production info shown at the bottom of this [Confluence readme](https://wiki.texastribune.org/display/TECH/AWS+hosts0).
